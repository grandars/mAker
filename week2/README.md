# Programming and wiring

In our second gathering we'll spend more time on the creation of simple programs, and wiring them up to LEDs and sensors.

We already have our computers set up to communicate with the boards and we can update the code on them, so this time we'll focus on four aspects of the development:

1)  The program syntax, and how the program runs. Flow control, functions, variables. This is familiar territory for anyone who knows a little programming from before, but very important to understand.
2) Serial output. The boards can communicate their state back to us through the USB cable. This is extremely useful for figuring out why something is not behaving as you expect.
3) Loading external libraries. Many sensors and electronic components have complex ways of communication. Luckily people smarter than us have made libraries that we can use.
4) Breadboard wiring. Wiring our projects correctly is important - otherwise we'll soon find ourself with a broken board and the smell of melted plastic. We'll go over the wiring of some basic projects.
